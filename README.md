# 🚀 Java Mastery: Data Structures, Algorithms & Core Concepts

Welcome to my Java repository!  
This project is a **comprehensive collection of implementations** for fundamental **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Core Java concepts** such as **Multithreading and Serialization**.

It serves as both:
- 📘 A structured **learning resource**
- 🎯 A solid **reference for technical interview preparation**

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository covers a wide spectrum of computer science topics, ranging from **basic sorting algorithms** to **advanced tree structures**, **graph traversals**, and **core Java internals**.

The codebase is designed to be:
- Modular
- Easy to navigate
- Concept-first
- Interview-oriented

## 📝 Repository Tips & Best Practices

Avoid committing .class and .ser files
Add the following to your .gitignore:

```text
*.class
*.ser
```

Use proper package declarations
If this grows into a large-scale project, package structure will greatly improve maintainability.
